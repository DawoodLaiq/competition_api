# FastAPI application

This is a Python web application built with the FastAPI framework that serves a quiz-style game. The application connects to an SQLite database to retrieve questions, validate team logins, and update team scores. The API includes several endpoints that return data in JSON format.

The / endpoint returns the number of questions in the database. The /login endpoint checks the team's login credentials against the database and returns their score, solved questions, and team color if successful. The /get_question/{id} endpoint retrieves a question by ID and, if available, returns any attachments associated with it. The /download_starter_code/{id} and /download_input_file/{id} endpoints allow users to download starter code and input files for a given question. The /get_teams_table endpoint returns a list of all teams and their scores. Finally, the /submit_answer endpoint accepts a POST request containing a team's answer to a question and updates the team's score if the answer is correct.
