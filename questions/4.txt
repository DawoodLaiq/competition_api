The input file contains a list of strings, one per line. The strings are all lowercase. Your job is to print
out the strings that meet the following criteria:

   Good strings have more than one letter 'c'.
   Good strings contain a letter 'e' in the first 3 letters.
   Good strings have at least 6 vowels.


Here is some starter code that can help you get started:
